# FenceMonsterProblem

Visualization of different solutions to the Fence Monster Problem.

## Problem Statement
You got kidnapped by aliens and thrown into a fenced circle. There is an alien monster leashed to the fence guarding you, so it can only move ON the circumference. You can move freely WITHIN the circle. You can also try to climb over the fence and escape, but if the monster's there, it will eat you alive. 

Assuming the monster's speed is 4x yours, can you escape? 


This repo visualizes 3 different paths:
* running straight to the opposite end of the circle
* looping the monster at an inner radius, then running straight to the circumference
* looping the monster at an inner radius, then taking an optimal curved path towards the circumference
